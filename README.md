# UTK_NE_python
A python primer focused on the Nuclear Engineering undergraduate courses

## Motivation

Nuclear engineers benefit tremendously from informal educational resources such as the Kansas State MCNP Primer. We would like to produce a similar resource for jumpstarting an undergraduate student's programming capability. Clearly a handful of PDF pages is insufficient to ``teach programming''; instead we seek to cover enough material to *get stuff done* using a programming language in the hopes that this provides the grounding for a motivated student to extend their knowledge using the many available resources suited to the task.

## Tools used

We focus on the following tools based on our experience. These may not be the best tools; students are encouraged to educate us about just how wrong we are.

### Python 3

Python provides the greatest balance between readability, expressiveness, and functionality of any language known to the authors. Other tools may be more visually engaging, faster, or readable, but Python balances all of these. It is also freely available and runs on a wide variety of hardware. Its broad standard library and comprehensive package index mean that it can be applied to almost any task and provide a **good enough** solution.

### NumPy/SciPy

These libraries provide a wealth of useful tools (fast matrix operations and optimization spring to mind) for nuclear engineers. They provide significant acceleration as well as providing (in a somewhat hidden way) typed N-dimensional arrays to Python.

### Jupyter

The Jupyter environment (specifically Jupyter Notebook) provides a ready-made UI for executing code snippets and plotting. It also simplifies

### Git

Version control is important to both scientists and programmers. We advise everyone who programs professionally to learn, live, and love Git and version control in general.
